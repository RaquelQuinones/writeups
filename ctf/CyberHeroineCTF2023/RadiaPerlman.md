# Analysis
It gives a website. That websites is about a DNS Queryng WebApp. The first thing was to inspect the website, found nothing useful,next was view the page source.
Next thing, was that the website url, took bash commands, but some of the commands the website noticed and didnt like. So that had to be worked around, until finally:
```
dns?ip=google.com;ks;strings%20flag.txt
```
Gave the flag.
