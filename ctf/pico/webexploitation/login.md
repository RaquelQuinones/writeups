## Analysis
We were given a website to get in. The link is:
```
https://login.mars.picoctf.net/
```
The website takes two inputs the *Username* and the *PassWord*. Since I don't have either
I ***inspected*** the page and went into the ***page view source***. 
There is a link named index.js (https://login.mars.picoctf.net/index.js). Inside its the code of how the webiste its alerted if a password and username are correct together.
If the correct alert is given, the flag is obtained. This is what we can admire:
```
insert here foto of website (My screenshot its working lol)
```
There we can some gibberish on the alert of the username. We take that and decode it with base64.
# -_- The flag was hidden in plain site:
```
picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
```
